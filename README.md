## Oscars Parties Made Easier

### Purpose
As a movie buff and friend of movie buffs, something I look forward to every year is gathering 'round the TV to gawk and applaud at what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has to say about the current state of movies. My friends and I have made it a habit to get together this special time of year and see who can most accurately predict the opinions of the HFPA.
As it stood, we would usually print out a spreadsheet and fill it out with a pen or pencil (it's 2020, we aren't cavemen), or simply vocalize our predictions as the awards happened (lame). 
This year, I decided to make an app to help expedite and improve the experience of predicting and competing in our annual Oscars watch party.
This was really just a fun, quick and easy app for me and my friends to use. Thanks for checking out!

### Features
* User account creation allows users to save their predictions per category and view the predictions of others
* App locks down once awards begin, and an admin user can manually select the winner of each award as they are announced
* A custom score keeping system grants credit where it is due, and a scoreboard is available to see where you rank among your friends

### Technologies
* React Native
* Node.js/Express
* Mongodb Atlas

### Potential Future Updates
* IMDb integration; clicking on a title in the prediction picker will redirect you to IMDb for more information and your current IMDb rating
